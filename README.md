# Python Interpreter 
* Python Interpreter for a toy language build in Python3 based on concepts of Object Oriented Programming.
 
* Functionalities added
 
  * If-Else Statement:
    - **`Condition`** in between **`if`** and **`then`**
    - Statements in between **`then`** and **`fi`**
    - **`fi`** should be followed by a **`;`**
    - **`if-else`** block can be inside another **`if-else`** block or **`while`** loop as well. 
  * While Statement:
    - **`Condition`** in between **`while`** and **`do`**
    - Statements in between **`do`** and **`done`**
    - **`done`** should be followed by a **`;`**
    - Similarly even the **`while`** loop can be inside an **`if-else`** block or another **`while`** loop.
  * Print Statement:
    - Works same as **`python3`** print statement and can print multiple arguments at once as well.
  * Println Statement:
    - **`println`** statement can be used to print a new line character just like in **Java**
